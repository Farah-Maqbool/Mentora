# Mentora 🎓

**Your personal academic mentor — one continuous conversation that guides you, builds your roadmap, and adapts as life happens.**

Mentora is an AI-powered mentorship platform for undergraduate and graduate students who want clear, personalised direction for their academic and career journey. Unlike generic AI chatbots, Mentora doesn't just answer questions — it gets to know you through a natural conversation, builds a real learning roadmap with curated sources, and keeps adjusting that plan as your circumstances change.

---

## ✨ What Makes Mentora Different

Mentora is built around a single ongoing conversation rather than separate chat sessions, so the context you share early on — your background, interests, and goals stays with you throughout. Instead of generating a one-off response, it works toward building a structured roadmap grounded in real, searched resources, tailored to your time and constraints. That roadmap isn't fixed as you share updates about your situation, Mentora revises it and keeps a history of how your plan has evolved. Daily reminders help keep the plan part of your routine rather than something generated once and forgotten.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Sign up** with your name, university, and current degree/field — the basics are captured once, immediately.
2. **Have a conversation** — Mentora dynamically asks about your interests, goals, available time, and constraints. No static forms, no rigid question lists — every question adapts to what you just said.
3. **Choose free or paid resources** — Mentora asks your preference before searching.
4. **Get your roadmap** — Mentora searches the web for real, relevant resources and generates a personalised, phased learning plan with links, timelines, and tips.
5. **Set a daily reminder** — pick a time, and Mentora emails you to stay on track.
6. **Life happens — tell Mentora** — if you fail an exam, land an internship, or change your goals, just say so. Mentora detects the change and revises your roadmap automatically, keeping a version history.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Mentora is built on a **multi-agent system** using LangGraph, where a supervisor routes each message to the right specialist agent based on the current state of the conversation.

```
User message
     ↓
 Supervisor (LLM-based routing)
     ↓
 ┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
 │ Onboarding  │   Search    │    Plan     │   Updater   │
 │   Agent     │   Agent     │   Agent     │   Agent     │
 └─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### Agents

- **Onboarding Agent** — drives the dynamic conversation, asks about interests, goals, time, constraints, resource preference, and reminder time. Silently extracts structured profile data from natural conversation. Also handles general chat and reminder-time updates once onboarding is complete.
- **Search Agent** — generates targeted search queries from the student's profile and finds real learning resources via Tavily.
- **Plan Agent** — synthesizes the profile and found resources into a structured, phased roadmap with timelines, steps, links, and tips.
- **Updater Agent** — detects life events (failed exams, new jobs, changed goals, etc.) using an LLM classifier, then revises the existing roadmap and saves a new version with a summary of what changed.

### Supervisor Routing Logic

```
onboarding_complete == False?        → Onboarding Agent
plan == None (after onboarding)?     → Search Agent → Plan Agent
plan exists + life event detected?   → Updater Agent
plan exists + normal message?        → Onboarding Agent (general chat)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mentora.git
cd mentora
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set up accounts (all free)

- **Groq** — [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) → create API key
- **Supabase** — [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → create project → run schema SQL → get URL + publishable key
- **Tavily** — [app.tavily.com](https://app.tavily.com) → get API key
- **Resend** — [resend.com](https://resend.com) → get API key

### 3. Configure secrets

Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
GROQ_API_KEY = "gsk_..."
SUPABASE_URL = "https://xxxx.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "eyJ..."
TAVILY_API_KEY = "tvly-..."
RESEND_API_KEY = "re_..."
```

### 4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Row Level Security (RLS) is disabled** on database tables for development simplicity. Not recommended for production use with real sensitive data without re-enabling RLS with proper authenticated requests.
- **Reminder times are UTC-only** — no automatic local timezone conversion yet.
- **Email reminders use Resend's test domain** (`onboarding@resend.dev`), which can only send to the email address associated with the Resend account. A verified custom domain is needed for reminders to work for all users.
- **Streamlit Cloud free tier** may sleep after inactivity, which can affect the reliability of the background reminder scheduler.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Proper timezone handling for reminders
- Re-enable RLS with authenticated Supabase requests
- Custom domain for transactional email
- Streaming LLM responses for a more natural chat feel
- Plan version history view for students
- Mobile-responsive layout improvements
